# Predictive-Modeling-of-Human-Development-Index-Trends-using-SAS
This repository contains the source code and analysis for a data-driven project that explores global human development indicators and university rankings using SAS. The project involves end-to-end data analysis, including data cleaning, visualization, descriptive statistics, hypothesis testing, and predictive modeling using SAS Rapid Predictive Modeler (RPM).

# 🎯Project Objectives
- Analyze and summarize human development indicators for Switzerland
- Explore relationships among metrics like Gender Inequality Index, HDI, IHDI, PHDI
- Examine student population patterns in global universities
- Quantify and visualize correlations between awards, publications, and teaching quality
- Conduct hypothesis tests to compare student distributions across countries
- Build a predictive model using SAS RPM to classify development index categories

# 🛠️Tools & Technologies
- SAS OnDemand for Academics 
- ROC IMPORT, PROC MEANS, PROC CORR, PROC UNIVARIATE, PROC TTEST
- SAS Rapid Predictive Modeler (RPM) for model automation
- Visuals: Histograms, Boxplots, Correlation Tables, ROC Curves, Lift Charts

# 📌Key Results
- Identified strong correlations (r > 0.8) among score, awards, and teaching quality
- Discovered statistically significant difference in student populations (p < 0.01) between USA and UK
- Predictive model achieved KS Score = 1.0 and very low Average Squared Error (~3.74e-7)
- Highlighted GII and HDI as key features influencing development index predictions

# 💡Insights & Applications
Demonstrates how educational and socioeconomic factors intertwine
Provides a framework to use SAS for predictive analytics and reporting
Highlights the power of automated modeling for quick decision-making

# 📈Future Enhancements
Rebuild the analysis pipeline using Python (pandas, scikit-learn) for open-source reproducibility
Deploy the model as a Flask API for real-time predictions
Extend dataset to include more countries and time-series forecasting
